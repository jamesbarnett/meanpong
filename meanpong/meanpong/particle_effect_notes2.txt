generate random starting point as an arc around collision point that depends upon player or ai collision

should angle be derived from collision point or randomly generated, or randomly generated by original point y position?

Have to experiment to find out.

possibly generate random paths of angle and A and B values on collision and add particles to them.  Maybe a bit of comet type effect.

Three primary factors: shape, velocity/acceleration, and color

Shape:

A piece-wise function by time? Curve fitting? A function of acceleration deltas by time?

Speed:

Probably faster at the beginning, slower at the end

Color:

Maybe white at the beginning, then fading in more red, then fade out.
